## HOW TO RUN COMMANDS:

make sure that all the booleans at the beginning of the run_wmass_cfg.py file
are set according to your needs and dreams and wishes.

test some events to **really** make sure:
```
 heppy <name> run_wmass_cfg.py -N 5000 
```

where <name> will be the name of the test output directory with the file and
directory structure


### then submit a production to the batch with condor:

```
heppy_batch.py run_wmass_cfg.py -o <localoutputdir> -r /store/cmst3/group/wmass/w-mass-13TeV/ntuples/WHATEVER -b 'run_condor_simple.sh -t 3000 ./batchScript.sh'
```

where <localoutputdir> is a directory which will have the structure and all the .url files
and WHATEVER is a useful, clear, and complete description of what the production has saved.

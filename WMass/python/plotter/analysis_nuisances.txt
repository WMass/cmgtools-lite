general uncertainties:
============================

CMS_VV:                 lnN     16%
CMS_lumi:               lnN     2.5%
CMS_Top:                lnN     6%
CMS_WXX_bkglepeff:      lnN     1% for mu, 2% for el
CMS_Wmu_lepVeto:        lnN     2% for mu, 3% for el   (only on Z, marco will check the real effect)
CMS_Tau:                lnN     4%
chargeflip:             lnN     10% (el only, let's keep the charge behavior in mind)

CMS_WXX_sig_lepeff      shape   on signal. SHOULD BE APPLIED TO ALL MC BACKGROUNDS ?!


CMS_XX_lepscale         shape   PROBLEMATIC. CHECK HOW IT BEHAVES IF mW SYSTEMATIC IS SCALED BY 10!!!

fake systematics:
============================

FakesEtaUncorrelatedX       lnN         4.6% for mu, 1-5% for el
FakesEtaChargeUncorrelated  lnN         2% in each bin of eta (0.5 for mu, 0.2 for el) -- maybe reduce to 1% for electrons
FakesPtNormUncorrelatedX    lnN         up to 30% for mu, large for el - bins of pT
FakesPtSlopeUncorrelatedX   template    bins in eta


efficiency systematics:
============================

ErfParEffStat       templates       bins of eta = 0.1: signal, Z, and tau

theory uncertainties:
============================

alphaS          shape       multiply by 0.67!!! - on Z, signal, tau
qcdscales       shape       signal and tau equal and decorrelated in pT, Z uncorrelated and unnumbered
pdfs            shape       for signal, Z, and tau - fully correlated
mW              shape       signal and tau
